### Short about the project
I chose to use Firebase/Firestore for authentication and as a backend to store all data. 
I could have used localstorage, however, that is not persistent if the user clear application data.
And for the fun of it, it was a good exercise to play around with firebase. 

All styling is done by using #vuetifyjs, which is a component framework for VueJS. 
The main reason for using this is for fast prototyping, also the exercise was about building a SPA, good architecture, coding style etc, which is why I chose to focus more on the JS.
